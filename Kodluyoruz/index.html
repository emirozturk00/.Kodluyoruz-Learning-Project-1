     <H1>Ephesus Ancient City</H1>
     <!--Paragraph-->
     <p>  Ephesus (/ËˆÉ›fÉªsÉ™s, ËˆÉ›fÉ™sÉ™s/;[1][2] Greek: á¼œÏ†ÎµÏƒÎ¿Ï‚, translit. Ã‰phesos; Turkish: Efes; may ultimately derive from Hittite: ð’€€ð’‰ºð’Š­,
      romanized: ApaÅ¡a) was a city in ancient Greece[3][4] on the coast of Ionia, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) southwest of present-day SelÃ§uk in Ä°zmir
      Province, Turkey. It was built in the 10th century BC on the site of the former Arzawan capital[5][6] by Attic and Ionian Greek colonists.
      During the Classical Greek era, it was one of twelve cities that were members of the Ionian League. The city came under the control of the
      Roman Republic in 129 BC. The city was famous in its day for the nearby Temple of Artemis (completed around 550 BC), which has been
      designated one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.[7] Its many monumental buildings included the Library of Celsus and a theatre 
      capable of holding 24,000 spectators.[8] Ephesus was recipient city of one of the Pauline epistles; one of the seven churches of Asia
      addressed in the Book of Revelation;[9] the Gospel of John may have been written there;[10] and it was the site of several 5th-century 
      Christian Councils (see Council of Ephesus). The city was destroyed by the Goths in 263. Although it was afterwards rebuilt, its importance
      as a commercial centre declined as the harbour was slowly silted up by the KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kmenderes River. In 614, it was partially destroyed by an earthquake.
      Today, the ruins of Ephesus are a favourite international and local tourist attraction, being accessible from Adnan Menderes Airport and 
      from the resort town KuÅŸadasÄ±. In 2015, the ruins were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
